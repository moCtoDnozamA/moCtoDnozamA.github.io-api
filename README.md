## PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT

We made initial wireframes and an ERD for our prompt. We tried several different approaches when creating our API. The first attempt, we found that we had a lot of nested data that was difficult to mentally parse, and decided to scrap the whole idea and create four models reflecting each part of our website. It taught us a lot about what /not/ to do, which in turn allowed us to learn from our mistakes and ultimately improve our skeletal design.
